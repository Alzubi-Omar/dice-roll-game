📌 Game Rules

The game starts with both players having 0 points.

A player rolls the dice:

If the result is 2-6, the value is added to the current round score.

If the result is 1, the player's turn ends and the score resets to 0.

The player can choose to "Hold":

The round score is added to the total score.

If the total score reaches 100, the player wins! 🎉

Otherwise, the turn switches to the other player.

Players take turns until someone wins.

The "New Game" button resets everything for a fresh start!

🎮 How to Play

Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice.

Decide whether to hold or roll again:

If you roll a 1, your round score resets to 0, and the turn switches.

Reach 100 points first to win the game!
